I am going to mv to 1 hacker way and I want to buy a new car. So I code a web-spider to collect cars' data on car.com and try to find some usefull info for myself. 

I downloaded around 63931 infos of cars which 30 miles around zip code 94025. I encode these info into json lines and then drawed some diagrams to visualize these data.

This bar diagram show the car brand distrubtions.

The thing supersing me is *Chevrolet* really have a huge amount of posts. Which make me more interested to find out their news cars' share on market. So I drawed a pie.

To have a comparing, I also found the US car brand market shares

We can see that the whole GM take 15% of the cake and the  *Chevrolet* contributed 10% and other parts most come from GMC. For other big players, like these Japanese brands, they market share is little bit bigger than their new car on the market(Toyota 14% > 11.7%, Honda 10% > 5.7%). Ford have 16% market share while only take 9.8% on new cars' pie. 

Beside these, I also visulized the Honda civic price distrubtion.
