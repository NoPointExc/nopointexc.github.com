## Save MySql user/password in php.   

Generally speaking, never save password in source code. Even the encrypted password. 

The reason is, anyone can get access to the source code and get the password. However, If I insist to that, what should I do?

For my doyouhavemypwd.com, I going to 
Save the password in a separate file outside the git tracked directory.   
Set the password only readable/writable for server root user.  

## Hashing word-list in MySql.

  [1](https://alias.io/2010/01/store-passwords-safely-with-php-and-mysql/)   
  [2](https://crackstation.net/hashing-security.htm)   

  hash(password + salt).

  Hash canâ€™t be something like md5(too weak) or use encryption algorithm to replace hash-function.  
  Salt: should randomly generated. 
  Use Cryptographically hash solution instead of invent your own.  
  Generate long salt cspring instead of use your own random algorithm, or even worth, use contains or a loop. 
  Salt can store in plain text just with the hashed password.
